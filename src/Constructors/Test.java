      /*When we create object
       *  Test t = new Test();
       *  after new keyword is called constructor part- Test().
       * There is two type of constructor a.default constructor(value provided by complier)
       *  b. user defined constructor( value provided by user)
       * Rules of constructors:
       * a)cons name and Class name are same
       * b)cons are able to take parameter.
       * c)cons doesn't allow to return type;
       * The Advantage of Cons-
        -----------------------
       * Constructors are using to write the logic of application.
          Those logic are executed during object is created.
       * Constructors are using to initialize some values to instance variables during object creation
      Cons calling
      -------------
       *  TO call the constructor generally used this keyword .
       *  this keyword must be first statement inside the constructor . 
       *  One constructor call multiple constructor but only one constructor  call at a time.
